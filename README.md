# Phase Transition of a Triangular Lattice Ising Model Using Monte Carlo Metropolis Algorithm
Here we numerically calculate the phase transition temperature for an Ising model of a ferromagnetic triangular lattice.  As a basis, we use code designed to calculate the phase transition temperature for a rectangular lattice and make the appropriate changes.  This code uses the Monte Carlo technique known as the Metropolis Algorithm.  First, each spin of the lattice is stored in an allocated matrix for the specified lattice dimensions.  Then, the datastructure for each variable of the Ising model is created in "ising_datastructure".  The steps for manipulating the lattice elements are given in "metropolis.c" and actually calculations are done in "ising.c", with the main function "ising-demo-metropolis.c" that uses all these functions to actually execute the computation.
